<div class="lyricssong">
Fatal, this attraction,<br>
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'<br>
But I'm ready if it happens with you<br>
Meet me out in Cali<br>
When I'm far away from family<br>
And I need someone to hold onto<br>

You're the only thing I know<br>
And I don't wanna let this go<br>
Close to you I feelâ€”feel like I'm at home<br>
Can't wait 'til we're alone<br>

We were built to last<br>
We were built like that<br>
Baby, take my hand<br>
Dive in this romance<br>
We could burn and crash<br>
We could take a chance<br>
Holdin' nothin' back<br>
Like it's our last dance<br>

Ref:Like it's our last dance<br>
Like it's our last dance<br>
Like it's our last dance<br>
Like it's our last dance<br>
