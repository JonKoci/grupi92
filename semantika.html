    <h1>Lion</h1>
    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa
         and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears,
          and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger 
          than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
          A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually
           hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although 
           some lions scavenge when opportunities occur
         and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>

<h1>Lion habitats</h1>
<p>he lion inhabits grasslands, savannas, shrublands and dry deciduous forests.
     It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts 
     to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion 
     ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia,
      but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population 
      in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations 
      in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside 
      designated protected areas. Although the cause of the
     decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>
